#Overview
The Employee Payroll project is a tool designed by Lahari Goshika to manage and calculate payroll information for employees. It processes data related to hours worked, overtime hours, hourly wage, and calculates the regular pay, overtime pay, and total pay for each employee for a given month.

#Data Format
The data for the Employee Payroll project is organized in a tabular format, with columns representing different attributes, and rows representing individual employees. The data includes the following columns:

Name: Full name of the employee.
First Name: First name of the employee.
Last Name: Last name of the employee.
Hourly Wage: The hourly wage rate for the employee.
1-Jan to 29-Jan: Hours worked for each week in January.
Regular Pay: Calculated regular pay for each week in January.
Overtime Pay: Calculated overtime pay for each week in January.
Total: Total pay for January.
Functionality
The Employee Payroll project performs the following tasks:

Calculates regular pay for each employee based on the hours worked and the hourly wage.
Calculates overtime pay for each employee if they have worked more than the standard working hours.
Calculates the total pay for each employee for the month of January.
Provides statistics such as the maximum, minimum, and average pay among the employees.
Data Range and Restrictions
The project assumes that the data provided is for the month of January. It can handle a maximum of 60 working hours per week and a minimum of 0 working hours per week. Overtime pay is calculated for hours worked beyond 40 hours per week, and the overtime pay rate is one and a half times the hourly wage.

#How to Use
To use the Employee Payroll project, the data for each employee's name, hourly wage, and hours worked for each week in January should be entered into the system. The project will then automatically calculate the regular pay, overtime pay, and total pay for each employee. It will also provide the statistics for the entire dataset, such as the maximum pay, minimum pay, and average pay.
